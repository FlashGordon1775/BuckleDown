        Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. 
        That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, 
        we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</br>

        My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, 
        I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna find out where my goddamn money is. She 
        gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and Winston or anybody 
        else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?
